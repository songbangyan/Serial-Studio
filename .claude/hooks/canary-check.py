"""Claude Code hook: verify the Context Canary on every assistant response.

Mechanizes the CLAUDE.md "Context Canary" probe (Stop event). The canary is
only useful if a mutated or missing line is actually *noticed*; a human stops
reading a boilerplate footer after a day, so this hook does the noticing
deterministically, at zero model-token cost.

On Stop it reads the session transcript (JSONL), takes the last non-empty
line of the final assistant message, and compares it against the expected
canary. Markdown decoration (backtick/bold/italic wrappers, whitespace
runs, formatting-only trailing lines like a closing code fence) is
normalized away first - the probe measures whether the *values* survived
in context, and a backtick-wrapped but value-perfect canary is a healthy
context, not a mutation. Outcomes:

  exact match      - silent (healthy context; success is invisible by design).
  "canary: lost"   - loud systemMessage: the model itself signaled degradation.
  mutated line     - loud systemMessage quoting the mutation (which value
                     drifted tells you which fact fell out of the workspace).
  missing entirely - loud systemMessage: instruction no longer steering.

Design choices specific to this repo:
  - Fail-open everywhere: any internal error exits 0 silently, matching the
    other hooks. A broken probe must never block real work.
  - Warn only, never block ("decision": "block" would re-invoke the model and
    burn the tokens this hook exists to avoid).
  - The expected line is duplicated from CLAUDE.md on purpose: reading it
    from the doc at check time would let a corrupted doc validate itself.
    If CLAUDE.md's canary changes, update EXPECTED_CANARY here in lockstep.
